Capstone Write-Up 2/21/2018

1) Hospital Readmissions and Home Health Care Quality:  Readmissions to a hospital after receiving initial services can be both costly and stressful for a patient dealing with a temporary illness or chronic disease.  This capstone would focus on the relationships between hospital readmission rates and positive, negative, or neutral Home Health Care Quality surveys.

2)  Cost and Utilization and Home Health Care Quality:  The cost of healthcare for an individual living in the United States can be extremely expensive in comparison to health care costs for other countries around the world.  This cost can vary even among different states within the US.  This capstone would focus on the relationship between cost and utilization or health care and positive, negative, or neutral Home Health Care Quality surveys.  Ideally this would tie in to topic one and can be further expanded upon to: How Does Cost and Utilization effect Home Health Care and what is Home Health Care’s effect on costly hospital readmissions?

3) Obesity and Health Insurance Incentives:  Obesity has scientifically been linked to chronic illness and increased utilization of health-care reasources.  Currently health insurance companies have offered refunds on gym membership to incentivize their members to increase physical activity.  This capstone asks if there are other factors to obesity that health insurance companies could build incentives around to reduce obesity, and subsequently health care utilization.
