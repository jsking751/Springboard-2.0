Capstone Write-Up 2/21/2018

1) Hospital Readmissions and Home Health Care Quality:  Readmissions to a hospital after receiving initial services can be both costly and stressful for a patient dealing with a temporary illness or chronic disease.  This capstone would focus on the relationships between hospital readmission rates and positive, negative, or neutral Home Health Care Quality surveys.

2)  Cost and Utilization and Home Health Care Quality:  The cost of healthcare for an individual living in the United States can be extremely expensive in comparison to health care costs for other countries around the world.  This cost can vary even among different states within the US.  This capstone would focus on the relationship between cost and utilization or health care and positive, negative, or neutral Home Health Care Quality surveys.  Ideally this would tie in to topic one and can be further expanded upon to: How Does Cost and Utilization effect Home Health Care and what is Home Health Care’s effect on costly hospital readmissions?

3) Food Inspections, Healthy Corner Stores and Crime Rates:  Healthy diets play a strong part of reducing obesity and obesity related chronic illnesses.  This capstone asks the question if healthier diet options are also related to reduced crime rates as well.  This study would look at the number of food inspections passes and failures along with the availability of Healthy Corner Stores to see if there is a relationship between better food options and lower or higher crime rates.  Is this statistically significant, and if so is the information reliable?
