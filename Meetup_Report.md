**Event: ODSC Meetup** 
<br><br>
The meetup I attended was an open part of ODSC East and involved two segments.  The first was two separate talks given by Allen Downey and Jeffrey Yau.  Allen’s talk involved data optimism and the ability for data scientists to use open source data to answer questions, bringing an evidence based answers to folk wisdom.  I found this talk to be exceptionally inspirational, and was encouraged in my current pursuit to become a data scientist.  Jeffrey’s talk was about integrating a data science team into an asset management company.  While not related to my field, I found this talk to be very informative with regards to how to build a successful data science team, and the trials and tribulations one faces in legacy work spaces.

The second part of the meetup was networking.  Much to my surprise I made several connections.  Those connections included a group of data science students involved with a program similar to that of Springboard’s.  I also networked with their mentor and a data scientist for the city who informed us of potential job openings that could be posted soon.  Overall, this was a very fruitful first foray into data science meetups.
